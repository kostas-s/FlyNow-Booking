Dear <%= @passenger.name %>

Thank you for choosing FlyNow for your flight tickets!

You have just booked a ticket from <%= @booking.flight.departure_airport.name %> to <%= @booking.flight.arrival_airport.name %>.
Flight time: <%= @booking.flight.date.to_formatted_s(:short) %>
See your booking details at <%= booking_url(@booking.id) %>

Of course this is a mock site so you don't need to worry, you haven't booked any actual tickets to anywhere! You can enjoy the safety of your home a while longer!
